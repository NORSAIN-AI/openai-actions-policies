  <h1>Privacy Policy for GPT Actions (Generic)</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025-11-13</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy explains how personal data may be processed when you use
    GPT Actions connected to systems or APIs operated by [Organization Name]
    (“we”, “us”).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data we process</h2>
  <p>
    When you use a GPT Action, the following types of data may be processed:

  <ul>
    <li>Text and content you submit to ChatGPT.</li>

    <li>Technical data handled by OpenAI (e.g., IP address, device information).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please do not submit sensitive personal data (such as health information or
    political opinions) through this service.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Purposes of processing</h2>
  <p>
    The data is used only to provide the functionality that the GPT Action is
    designed for, such as lookups, analysis or automation based on our APIs and
    systems.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal basis</h2>
  <p>
    The legal bases for processing usually include:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Legitimate interest – to improve and secure the service at an aggregated level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Storage and deletion</h2>
  <p>
    OpenAI stores and processes the data you submit to ChatGPT in accordance with
    its own terms and privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We generally do not store personally identifiable data from GPT Actions.
    Any logs from our APIs are primarily technical logs for troubleshooting,
    security and capacity planning, and are stored for a limited period, normally
    no longer than [X months].
